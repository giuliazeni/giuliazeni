### Hi there!
👩‍🏫 I was a self-employed foreign-language instructor for ten years (Italian, English, French, Spanish, German)

💻 I then graduated in Web Dev from [Le Wagon](www.lewagon.com) in March 2023

👀 Our final project was [CareerPal](https://www.careerpal.me/), one of the best 3 in my batch

👩‍💻 I decided to pursue a career in Product Management and found a great and supportive team at prosperity solutions, which I joined in August '23.
